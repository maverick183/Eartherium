# Eartherium
Eartherium is a digital land ownership experiment inspired by the global housing crisis. With 1B fixed supply and  71 M km² of land, each token represents a share of Earth. As supply circulates, more of the 3D globe becomes digitally occupied, visualizing scarcity, ownership, and meme culture in real time.
